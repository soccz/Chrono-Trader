**Chrono-Trader** is a sophisticated cryptocurrency forecasting and recommendation engine designed to identify high-potential trading opportunities. It leverages a state-of-the-art hybrid model combining a **Transformer Encoder** with a **GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) Decoder** to analyze market trends and generate actionable trading signals.

The system is built to evolve, continuously learning from new market data and fine-tuning its ensemble of models to adapt to ever-changing market dynamics.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🧠 Hybrid AI Model**: Utilizes a Transformer Encoder to understand deep market context and a GAN Decoder to generate realistic future price scenarios.
- **🤖 Ensemble Learning**: Employs an ensemble of three distinct hybrid models to ensure robust, stable, and reliable predictions.
- **🎯 Dual-Strategy Recommendations**: Generates trading signals based on two distinct strategies for comprehensive market coverage:
    1.  **High-Confidence Trends**: Identifies trending assets and recommends those with the highest model prediction confidence.
    2.  **Dynamic Pattern Following**: Discovers assets whose recent price action mimics the predicted future of other top-performing assets.
- **🔄 Continuous Learning**: A `daily` pipeline automatically collects new data, fine-tunes the models, and generates updated recommendations, allowing the system to adapt over time.
- **🔧 Extensible & Configurable**: Key model hyperparameters and operational modes are easily configurable through `config.py` and CLI arguments.

## 🏛️ Model Architecture

The core of Chrono-Trader is its hybrid model architecture. The **Transformer Encoder** acts as the analytical "brain," processing complex time-series data to form a rich understanding of the market's context. This understanding is then passed to the **GAN Decoder**, which acts as a creative "hand," generating a probable 6-hour future price pattern.

    D[Random Noise] --> C;
    C --"Generated Future Pattern<br>(6-hour Forecast)"--> E[Output: Prediction];
```

## 📊 Sample Result

Here is an example of a recommendation generated by **Chrono-Trader**:
